# Tech Career Explorer
![alt text](statics/project_demo.png)
In this data engineering project, I develop an end-to-end solution to find and analyse the current tech job positions from famous sites like [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/) and [glassdoor](glassdoor.com). I build a pipeline to crawl and extract job data from these sites, process and model the data before finally visualising the results in a metabase dashboard.
## Used Technologies
- Workflow orchestration: **Mage**
- Data Warehouse: **PostgreSQL** (for production DW), DuckDB (for develpment DW and backup)
- Batch processing: **DBT**
- Dashboard: **Metabase**

## Evaluation Criteria
### Problem description
In the current job market, itâ€™s challenging to keep track of job postings across multiple platforms like LinkedIn and Glassdoor. The data is vast and scattered, making it difficult for job seekers and recruiters to make informed decisions. Moreover, the lack of a centralized system for storing and analyzing this data exacerbates the problem.

Project Structure: 
![alt text](statics/project_schema.png)

To address this issue, I have developed a data pipeline and dashboard. The project begins by crawling job position data from various platforms such as LinkedIn and Glassdoor. This data is then transformed and loaded into a data warehouse, providing a centralized storage solution for all the job data.

The project utilizes both ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) methodologies for data transformation. DBT (Data Build Tool) is used for performing transformations in the data warehouse, while Mage-AI is used for ETL processes, ensuring that the data is clean, reliable, and ready for analysis.

Finally, a dashboard is created using Metabase, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the data. This dashboard allows users to gain insights from the data.

This project effectively addresses the problem of scattered job data, providing a streamlined solution for job data extraction, transformation, loading, and analysis. It serves as a valuable tool for both job seekers and recruiters in the modern job market.
